# Design Decisions

The following choices have been made with respect to application design:

* Initially targeting web development, possibly mobile development later.
* Two tiered architecture consisting of a database and a web application,
  possibly a third service layer in the middle if time/resources permit.
* Database engine of choice is [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) intended for use to access data in the database.
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) intended for use as an MVVM tool for the user interface.

# Useful Resources

The following are some other useful resources for the project:

* [Basic Markdown Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), which should help you update this readme file.
* [Recipe Book SCRUM/Kanban board](https://fpujbw.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/RBK/boards/1) (using Jira by Atlassian software).
